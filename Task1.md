First Task

We are we are trying to launch a service that is making your home smarter. It is me and my cofounder from Stanford MBA he has built a prototype that lets him speak to Alexa microphone which takes in the command and interprets what he is saying to take an action like opening up curtains, changing lights or putting alarm clock for him whenever he wants, he has built the basic Pipe now our aim is to let others know about what we are doing our basic assumption is this basic Jarvis life feature would be appealing to vast majority of the people so if he can create a awareness off what we have done I think there is a strong chance that others would want this set up now. The problem is what we are using is basically a bunch of different products and we set them up in the right configuration and there is actually a lot of hassle to go on about this what we're hoping to do is take that fiction away from you and said come to your home and setting up so you can directly start using it so this is the initial version of our start up idea but one thing is that fundamental there is no reason that why you wouldn't do it yourself which is fine we encourage you to do if you can, but if you want, we can take away that friction from you. So that is the basic premise of what we're trying to do now the next action from us is to be able to find those target customers. The only problem is that even though we can create nice videos or whatever that is actually investment from the user site since they need to buy all the smart devices, so there is also some trust problem with what you're trying to solve all of this, we are trying to grow. We are hoping to apply to VC at November 10th. By the time we get early customers, probably 10 15 20 numbers. But more importantly, we visit to trying to get some sort of a list so that when we apply to YC we can show them or yeah we have done our work. We will reach out to customers we got feedback.

So our target at this very point is how identify our customer customer target pool second type of messaging they would be receptive to remember they are trying to grow. We are not trying to put up a corporate structure here so it could be that we can use my cofounders Stanford NBA network to reach out to people just like DoorDash it so we're trying to grow like we are trying to find out of the box ideas here also we probably will try to understand what type of media these people consume and what type of TikTok say we can highlight what we have done to make it appealing to people and make it to showcase then people cannot imagine what we are doing is a basic idea. Read this I have to told you here and make it structured for us to be able to talk over it
