2. **McKinsey alumni** - likely Segment A/B (high income, convenience-focused)
3. **Apple contacts** - likely Segment C (tech-forward but appreciate professional help)

**Warm Call Script Framework**:
```
"Hey [Name], hope you're doing well! Quick question - do you have any smart home devices?
[If yes] How's that working out for you? Any integration headaches?
[If frustrated] Actually, that's exactly what we're solving with our new service..."
```

**Follow-up Questions**:
- "What devices do you have?"
- "What made you choose those specific ones?"
- "Ever try to get them to work together?"
- "What's your biggest frustration?"

### Cold Outreach Strategy

**Channel Prioritization**:
1. **Reddit** (highest intent signals)
2. **Discord** (community trust building)
3. **Social Media** (broad awareness)
4. **Direct outreach** (lowest priority initially)

**Cold Contact Qualification**:
- Scan post history for smart device mentions
- Look for frustration signals in comments
- Check if they're actively seeking solutions
- Verify they're in target demographic/geography

**Cold Outreach Templates**:

**Reddit DM** (after helpful comment):
```
"Saw your post about [specific device issue]. I've helped 15+ people with this exact problem.
Mind if I share what usually works? Also curious - do you have other smart devices that aren't
playing nice together?"
```

**LinkedIn** (for network connections):
```
"Hi [Name], noticed we both have [shared connection/background]. Are you into smart home tech at all?
Working on something that might interest you if you've ever dealt with device integration headaches."
```
